# \#1 Node Challenge from Rocketseat

This is my first Node project. I developed it from a challenge proposed by the Rocketseat Node course.

I had to develop a basic CRUD API, using only the building blocks from Node, without any framework, so I could tell that I've learned the fundamentals so far. In addition, I've build a kind of "CSV upload support", since my API is capable of reading CSV, but doesn't support a CSV upload, so it is not useful in real world scenario, but was useful for me to understand better how Node Streams work.

Furthermore, I've also leard a lot about HTTP requests and responses, as well as how to format strings using regex, which I used to match the routes' and querys'.

If you wish to test it, just download Node v18.17.1 and run the command

```zsh
node --watch src/server.js
```

and use our testing API of choice to run the HTTP requests.
